# ReactNative

React Native work goes here.

App Ideas:
- <i>poems</i>, prototyped for poetry month, enables what in my experience has been a surprising and depthful poesis of text. The kernel of the idea is simple enough: split up body of text in an app; read a drop; tap for more. I'd like to return to this project to widen the array of public domain works readable therein and add features. One more personal goal is to develop a poetry "appbook."
-<i>tracks</i> represents a cross between my interest in SVG-based animation in React Native and love for New York City subways. The idea is to build up from math and JavaScript (as opposed to, say, Unity2D) a way of animating systems as trains on tracks. (Ruby on Rails has playfully been a source of inspiration.) One outcome may be a game in which players construct systems of tracks and stations. It's a work in progress, but it's already taught me a lot. The biggest roadblocks I've hit so far have had to do with (lack of) understanding of math and physics, but as of now (November '17) I'm gearing up to return.

Projects for Setphen Grider's "Complete React Native and Redux" Udemy course: 
- <i>albums</i> is a still-initial app project through which I learned the styling and building of basic React components. Tested on iOS and Android emulators. Source: Stephen Grider's <i>The Complete React Native and Redux Course</i> on Udemy.
- <i>auth</i> is a second app project via Stephen Grider's course. Through this project I learned basics of working with Firebase, controlled components (declaring state to handle user input), helper functions, reusable components, and user feedback mechanisms to create a simple authentication app. Tested on iOS and Android emulators. Implemented minor platform-specific styling.
- <i>manager</i> is the final app project of Grider's course. In this project, I applied knowledge from previous projects to create a simple CRUD application with authentication. Tested on iOS and Android emulators. Implemented minor platform-specific styling.
- <i>tech_stack</i> is a third app project from Grider's course. This project introduced me to working with Redux and the ability to associate particular app states with actions via reducer functions. Along the way I also learned how to implement basic animation via LayoutAnimation and render a list of elements in a performant manner via ListView. Tested on iOS and Android emulators.
