React Native work goes here.

Contents:

- <i>AwesomeProject</i> and <i>testing-for-now</i> are initial stabs at playing around.

- <i>albums</i> is a still-initial app project through which I learned the styling and building of basic React components. Tested on iOS and Android emulators. Source: Stephen Grider's <i>The Complete React Native and Redux Course</i> on Udemy.

- <i>auth</i> is a second app project via Stephen Grider's course. Through this project I learned basics of working with Firebase, controlled components (declaring state to handle user input), helper functions, reusable components, and user feedback mechanisms to create a simple authentication app. Tested on iOS and Android emulators. Implemented minor platform-specific styling.

- <i>tech_stack</i> is a third app project from Grider's course. This project introduced me to working with Redux and the ability to associate particular app states with actions via reducer functions. Along the way I also learned how to implement basic animation via LayoutAnimation and render a list of elements in a performant manner via ListView. Tested on iOS and Android emulators.
