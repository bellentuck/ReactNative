Trains & tracks. Reimagining transportation bit by bit. One idea, you don't do the trains. You do the tracks. What if trains were come and go at their leisure like cats? What if tracks were your baseline separation from abyss? Your way of saying yes to creation? Yes from a "thus they were" of harmony and even beauty of things themselves in motion to a "thus I willed it" of tracks in rhythm and even coordination? Or, other idea, imagine you are controlling the train or at least getting to follow it, along its tracks, its route. Here's trying to do all that and more. First tracks and trains and simple animations, animation being the big hurdle I'm currently grappling with in this project. The simple (not necessarily easy) bits are fun. Too, though, change how people (think about) travel. Make that more efficient, and fun, and less of a hassle and more of a game.
